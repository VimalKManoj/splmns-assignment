📄 ##Overview

This project is a web-based interactive animation playground built using Next.js, GSAP, and Tailwind CSS as part of a technical challenge.

The application includes two versions showcasing animated text interactions with randomized floating effects and clean motion design.=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.


##Tech Stack

Next.js (App Router)
React
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
GSAP (for advanced animations)

##How It Works

📌 Version One:
User submits text via a form.

Text animates from input box to a portal animation on the right.

Submissions are stored in localStorage.

Clicking "Go to Submissions" navigates to /submissions, where the texts fly out of the portal with randomized motion.

📌 Version Two:
User inputs text via a form on the left side of the screen.

On submission, text animates to the right side.

Text undergoes randomized position, text splitting, and SVG animations.

More visual emphasis on the split text and animated icons on arrival.
