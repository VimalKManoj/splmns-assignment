# Overview

This project is a web-based interactive animation playground built using **Next.js, GSAP, and Tailwind CSS** as part of a technical challenge.

The application includes two versions showcasing animated text interactions with randomized floating effects and clean motion design.


## Tech Stack

Next.js (App Router)
React
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
GSAP (for advanced animations)

## 📽️ How It Works

### 📌 Version One:
- User submits text via a form.
- Text animates from input box to a **portal animation on the right**.
- Submissions are stored in **localStorage**.
- Clicking **"Go to Submissions"** navigates to `/submissions`, where the texts fly out of the portal with randomized motion.

### 📌 Version Two:
- User inputs text via a form on the **left side of the screen**.
- On submission, text animates to the **right side**.
- Text undergoes **randomized position, text splitting, and SVG animations**.
- More visual emphasis on the **split text** and **animated icons** on arrival.
